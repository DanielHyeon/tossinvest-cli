## Inputs and invariants

| Input/state | Valid range | Source of truth | Failure behavior |
|---|---|---|---|
| unchanged by this change | as before | as before | as before |

## Branches and early returns

A screen that reloads itself cannot keep a native <details> open, so its explanatory disclosures are driven by a URL parameter that the reload carries with it. The parameter is display-only and reaches no judgement, save or audit record. Reads the fold state out of the request. The holdings read, the exit-line attachment, the single adoption Load that stamps both lists, and Refresh are unchanged.

## State mutations and fallbacks

- No domain mutation; a get render.
- No new broker call, no new config key, no new audit record, no new POST route.

## Safety conclusion

- Safe edit boundary: display, classification and routing.
- Neither this change nor this function touches order submission, stop-loss, take-profit, sizing, the Guardian gate's judgement, the ledger, reconciliation, authentication or fill handling. The Guardian limits change in DISPLAY only: the submit path, the field names, GuardianLimits.Validate, CeilingViolations and the writer are untouched, and the screen states the direction of a change without refusing one. The console's set of state-changing acts does not grow — the four routes this change adds are GET reads with no form.
