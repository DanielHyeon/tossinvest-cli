## Inputs and invariants

| Input/state | Valid range | Source of truth | Failure behavior |
|---|---|---|---|
| unchanged by this change | as before | as before | as before |

## Branches and early returns

a055 did not edit this function. It appears here because a055's base commit (b331f664) predates a054's implementation, which is still uncommitted, so the diff against that base carries a054's functions too. The Function Logic Map of record for this function is a054's, in `openspec/changes/archive/2026-08-02-a054-console-status-shell/analysis/function-logic/`. Its current bytes hash to exactly what a054 recorded, which is how this classification was made rather than asserted.

## State mutations and fallbacks

- None by this change.
- No new broker call, no new config key, no new audit record, no new POST route.

## Safety conclusion

- Safe edit boundary: display, classification and routing.
- Neither this change nor this function touches order submission, stop-loss, take-profit, sizing, the Guardian gate's judgement, the ledger, reconciliation, authentication or fill handling. The Guardian limits change in DISPLAY only: the submit path, the field names, GuardianLimits.Validate, CeilingViolations and the writer are untouched, and the screen states the direction of a change without refusing one. The console's set of state-changing acts does not grow — the four routes this change adds are GET reads with no form.
