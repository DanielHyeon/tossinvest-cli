# Function Logic Map: `Console.writeOptimizationApplyError`

- Source: `internal/console/optimization_view.go`
- AST evidence: `ast.json` (revision: current)
- Risk scan: `risk-pattern-report.md`

## Inputs and invariants

| Input/state | Valid range | Source of truth | Failure behavior |
|---|---|---|---|
| unchanged by this change | as before | as before | as before |

## Branches and early returns

A page constructor now reaches the console so it can build the shared chrome. One call site updated to the method form. The status codes and the CSP it renders the conflict page under are unchanged.

| Branch | Condition | Mutation/side effect | Return/error | Required test |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| B1 | if at line 300 | no domain mutation; a GET render | unchanged behaviour | `TestEveryScreenRendersTheSameStatusStrip`, `TestEachScreenKeepsItsOwnReloadPeriod`, `TestEveryScreenIsCalledOneThing` |
| B2 | if at line 305 | no domain mutation; a GET render | unchanged behaviour | `TestEveryScreenRendersTheSameStatusStrip`, `TestEachScreenKeepsItsOwnReloadPeriod`, `TestEveryScreenIsCalledOneThing` |

## Calls and live bindings

| Callee | Why called | Error/timeout/retry contract | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| see `ast.json` calls | 7 call sites, unchanged in contract by this change | no retry introduced | AST + CodeGraph |

## State mutations and fallbacks

- No domain mutation; a get render.
- No new broker call, no new config key, no new audit record.

## Safety conclusion

- Safe edit boundary: display and routing.
- Neither this change nor this function touches order submission, stop-loss, take-profit, sizing, the Guardian gate, the ledger, reconciliation, authentication or fill handling. The console's set of state-changing acts does not grow: the two routes this change adds are GET reads with no form.
