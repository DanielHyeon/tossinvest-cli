# Branch Test Map: `strategyProposalAuthorityPair.ResultAuthority`

- Source: `internal/app/engine/strategy_proposal_authority.go`; file SHA-256 `88e06b6c841ba30cb1c3107fba33c134c82b34f871dec646ee92b739a2e58c94`. AST branch positions are authoritative.
- Rows carry measured counts from Go coverage profiles, count mode.
- untagged proposal suite: `go test -count=1 -covermode=count -coverpkg=./internal/strategyproposal ./internal/strategyproposal/`
- tagged proposal suite: `go test -count=1 -tags tossos_testseams -covermode=count -coverpkg=./internal/strategyproposal,./internal/strategyflow,./internal/strategyrouter,./internal/app/engine ./internal/strategyproposal/`
- tagged engine suite: `go test -count=1 -tags tossos_testseams -covermode=count -coverpkg=./internal/strategyproposal,./internal/strategyflow,./internal/strategyrouter,./internal/app/engine ./internal/app/engine/`
- untagged engine suite: `go test -count=1 -covermode=count -coverpkg=./internal/strategyproposal,./internal/strategyflow,./internal/strategyrouter,./internal/app/engine ./internal/app/engine/`

| Branch | Anchor | Measured disposition |
|---|---|---|
| B1 | if at 98:3 | arm not entered (untagged proposal suite); arm not entered (tagged proposal suite); arm not entered (tagged engine suite); arm not entered (untagged engine suite); no per-test profile in the attribution set entered it |

A row states what was measured, not what is intended. An arm recorded as not entered is a coverage gap, not a pass.
